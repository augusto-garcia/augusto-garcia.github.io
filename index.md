### Education

I have a PhD in Genetics and Plant Breeding
([Department of Genetics](http://www.genetica.esalq.usp.br/), "Luiz de
Queiroz" College of Agriculture, University of São Paulo -
[ESALQ/USP](http://www.esalq.usp.br/) and a post-doc in Statistical
Genetics ([Bioinformatics Research Center](http://brc.ncsu.edu/),
North Carolina State University, USA).

### Professional Activities

I started my career as a researcher working with sugarcane breeding
(1995-1998) at
[Federal University of São Carlos](http://pmgca.dbv.cca.ufscar.br/),
Araras, SP, Brazil. After, I moved to the
[Department of Statistics](http://www.lce.esalq.usp.br/) at ESALQ/USP,
teaching Calculus, Statistics and Experimental Designs (1998-2002).
Nowadays, I am a faculty of
[Department of Genetics](http://www.genetica.esalq.usp.br/)
(ESALQ/USP), teaching Genetics, Plant Breeding and Statistical
Genetics.


### Research

The ultimate goal of my research projects is trying to have a better
understanding of the genetic architecture of quantitative traits,
specially (but not exclusively) for polyploids, with emphasis on
sugarcane. This could be useful for breeding programs and for
geneticists interested on complex traits.

To achieve this goal, I have been investigating statistical genetics
methods related to: i) linkage mapping; ii) quantitative trait loci
(QTL) mapping; iii) association mapping; iv) genomic selection.

Breeding programs always need to take into consideration important
phenomenon such as genotype by environment interaction, and the
presence of correlation between traits. My group is also investigating
these subjects.

### Publications

You can find a list with all my publications on my
[Google Scholar](http://scholar.google.com/citations?user=xLd8lNoAAAAJ)
page. Also, look at my [Mendeley profile](). You can download my CV by

### Lab

I proudly coordinate a
[Statistical Genetics Laboratory](http://statgen.esalq.usp.br/) and
advisor a number of students, including undergrads, MSc candidates,
PhD candidates, and post-docs. For more information, visit the Lab
website. 

### Posts

Occasionally, I also wrote some tutorials about subjects related with
my research activities. Most of them are focused on my students, but
they could also be interesting for a broader audience.
