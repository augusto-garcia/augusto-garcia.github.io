This is the professional web page that I am keeping outside the
University system. My official
[site](http://docentes.esalq.usp.br/aafgarci/) is hard to maintain and
is always outdated. Please, check here if you are looking for new
information.

### Education

I have a PhD in Genetics and Plant Breeding
([Department of Genetics](http://www.genetica.esalq.usp.br/), "Luiz de
Queiroz" College of Agriculture, University of São Paulo -
[ESALQ/USP](http://www.esalq.usp.br/) and a post-doc in Statistical
Genetics ([Bioinformatics Research Center](http://brc.ncsu.edu/),
North Carolina State University, USA).

### Professional Activities

I started my career as a researcher working with sugarcane breeding
(1995-1998) at
[Federal University of São Carlos](http://pmgca.dbv.cca.ufscar.br/),
Araras, SP, Brazil. After, I worked at
[Department of Statistics](http://www.lce.esalq.usp.br/) at ESALQ/USP,
teaching Calculus, Statistics and Experimental Design (1998-2002).
Nowadays, I am a faculty of
[Department of Genetics](http://www.genetica.esalq.usp.br/)
(ESALQ/USP), teaching Genetics, Plant Breeding and Statistical
Genetics.


### Research

The ultimate goal of my research projects is trying to have a better
understanding of the genetic architecture of quantitative traits. This
could be useful for breeding programs and for geneticists interested
on complex traits.

To achieve this goal, I have been investigating statistical genetics
methods related to: _i)_ linkage mapping; _ii)_ quantitative trait
loci (QTL) mapping; _iii)_ association mapping; _iv)_ genomic
selection.

Breeding programs always need to take into consideration important
phenomenon such as genotype by environment interaction, and the
presence of correlation between traits. These topics have also being
investigated.

### Publications

You can find a list with all my publications on my
[Google Scholar](http://scholar.google.com/citations?user=xLd8lNoAAAAJ)
page, and also on
[bibbase.org](http://www.bibbase.org/cgi-bin/pyBibBase/pyBibBase.cgi?bib=www.bibbase.org/mendeley/6cc6f2d7aa&groupby=year&simplegroups=1&charset=utf-8).
You can dowload my CV clicking [here](/files/CV_Augusto_Garcia.pdf).

### Lab

I proudly coordinate a
[Statistical Genetics Laboratory](http://statgen.esalq.usp.br/) and
advisor a number of students, including undergrads, MSc candidates,
PhD candidates, and post-docs.

### Posts

Occasionally, I also post some tutorials about subjects related with
my activities. Most of them are focused on my students, but they could
also be interesting for a broader audience.
